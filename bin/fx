# Xcode sometimes gets sad and won't index or other shenanigans. You can easily cheer up Xcode
# and get things happy again by simply removing some files. This little script does just that.

# Quit Xcode
osascript -e 'tell app "Xcode" to quit'

# Remove derived data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*

# Open all Xcode projects in current directory
open *.xcodeproj
